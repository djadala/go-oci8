some changes to mattn go-oci8 sql driver:

-driver doesn't pass go pointers to CGO, can work with future go versions/moving garbage collectors	(all C.WrapOCI... functions )
-support more oracle types, blob, clob, timestamp, interval, rowid
-return INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH as int64(months)
-return INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND as int64(nanosecs, can be cast to duration)
-return rowid as string
-native support for float64, int64

-added isolation level parameter to dsn, transactions can be READONLY,SERIALIZABLE, READWRITE
-removed LastInsertId  from Result, oracle returns LastInsertId as rowid descriptor,
		can't be converted to int64, only to string
-when connection are not in transaction, changes to database are autocommited
-no need for loc dsn parameter - dates are returned as timestamp, server inserts its local timezone

-many bugs fixed:
1.
  all checks 'rv == OCI_ERROR' are incorrect, there are other error values.
  for example in 'func (c *OCI8Conn) Begin() (driver.Tx, error)' call to
  C.OCITransStart return OCI_INVALID_HANDLE and it never worked.
  all checks must be 'if rv !=  OCI_SUCCESS'
2.
  original blob code works only if tranfered bytes len < 4000, else only first 4000 bytes are returned
